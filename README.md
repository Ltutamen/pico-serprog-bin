# pico-serprog-bin
This repository contains built .uf2 file from [pico-segprog repository](https://codeberg.org/libreboot/pico-serprog), that I needed to flash libreboot using pashpbeddy pi pico as a progammator.
Since source repo does not provide build file for some reason, I've decided to upload it for everyone, who does not want to waste time setting up arm toolchain.
### NOTE
NOte that rpi pico might be not powerefull enough to flash, so an external 3.3V pover supply is needed!
